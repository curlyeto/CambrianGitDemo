# I love programming. I feel comfortable and peaceful when I write code. I graduated computer engineer in Turkey. I used most of the languages. 

# C++, java,c#, python, PHP,kotlin and dart.I developed web, android, ios and desktop applications with this language. 

# I have just 2 years of work experience in turkey. I'm working on the most of projects with my team. I took this program because I need to work permit to work in Canada. 

# I want to learn information that I don't know about that courses.

# For that course How can I write my code with the most performance and more quality?

# I like birds because they're free and can whenever they want.

# The animal of my characteristic property is a bull. I'm a very stubborn person and I don't like to give up until I get what I want.

# I wish everyone a happy and healthy day :)

# Best regards.
